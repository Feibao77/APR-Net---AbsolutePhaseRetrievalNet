# APR-Net: Deep learning-based frequency-multiplexing composite-fringe projection profilometry technique for one-shot 3D shape measurement
If you need more information, see our [paper]().

## 1. Introduction
APR-Net enables pixel-wise prediction of the absolute phase map from a single deformed frequency-multiplexing composite image. A nested strategy leveraging Residual U-block (RSU) and the concept of centralized information interaction (CII) are employed.

## 2. Architecture of APR-Net
